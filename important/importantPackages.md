# Packages

## IMPORTANT

This is not a complete list! I maybe missed a lot of stuff...

It should be mostly for me as a backup
if I forget my packages or so I know what I have to install on a new system.

I know I should switch to NixOS I also want to but till now I haven't found
the time to read the documentation.
